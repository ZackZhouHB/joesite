===================================================================


My name is <b>"Joe Zhou"</b>, I am 8 years old. My dream is to become a famous writer with fantastic books to inspire people. 



I like: 

- <b>Reading</b> : I read widely and carefully as it is the 1st step and a key to achieving my writer's dream, my most recent favourite books are from David Williams and Roald Dahl.

- <b>School</b> : I am current a year 3 student at E.P.S Sydney New South Wales, Australia.

- <b>Writing</b> : Since 6 years old, I have started to write several books with some of my bright and creative ideas.
