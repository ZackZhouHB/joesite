<b>Chapter 1 - The Spickerock Family</b>


There was once a village called Ant-Ville where my parents and I lived. Ant-Ville nestled on the grassland of a filthy family, the Spikerock family. The household had a mother, a father and a child. The little one was the nastiest of them. 


The female was as lean as a pencil, tall as a tree and her diet was rotten apples and mashed-up pig ears. Her name was Tina, always had complaints and had a beastly pale white face with layers and layers of make-up. 


The male was enormously fat. He was named Zack and was as round as the bowling ball. Zack was extremely strong. For example, he once killed a man, by just penetrating his thumb into the poor fellow’s heart! His food was three huge bowls of buns with snake tongue stuffing. 


The boy, like I said, was the worst, he wore a menacing grin, a lumpy, black coat, wicked pants, and his hair was as messy as a crow’s nest. The nasty beast whose name is Joe would creep to Ant-Ville, every midnight with dark circles around his eyes. Then, he would squish the snoring ants to death. 


Every time we saw Joe attacking the ants, we sang a sad little tune:

{% highlight shell %}

The Spickerocks are so unkind,
When will they leave the ants behind?
They squish and mash without any care,
We hope they’ll stop, then it’s finally fair
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes, while singing this method, I feel sorry for the harmed ants.
