My life changed when a lady carrying a baby sister bottled me up in a transparent plastic container. I wonder why she has captured me. The most likely reason was because of my glowing, purple-tipped legs and yellow spots.



The mother dumped me into a bag of fruit and veggies and trotted somewhere. As she walked, I could feel her feet bumping against mine and the bag shaking like a tremendous earthquake.



Not long afterwards, the earthquake stopped. I heard a door open quietly. At that moment, I felt a mix of fear and curiosity rushing within me. The woman dropped the bag on the floor and after putting all the groceries inside the fridge, she took hold of my bottle and placed it on the kitchen table. 



I took a vast look around. I saw a grey, soft sofa, a big-screened television, a grand dining table, cool lights, baby toys and thick books. For extra information, I spotted a bowl of fruit on my left side and a jar of peanut butter and Nutella on the right. After, the lady raced outside in the rush.



Since the woman was not there, I tried to escape. However, from gnawing walls to kicking sides, none of them seemed to work. Exhausted, I drifted to slumber.
