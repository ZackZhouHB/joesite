<b>MONDAY - The Day it started 2024/03/17</b>



My life changed when a lady carrying a baby sister bottled me up in a transparent plastic container. I wonder why she has captured me. The most likely reason was because of my glowing, purple-tipped legs and yellow spots.



The mother dumped me into a bag of fruit and veggies and trotted somewhere. As she walked, I could feel her feet bumping against mine and the bag shaking like a tremendous earthquake.



Not long afterwards, the earthquake stopped. I heard a door open quietly. At that moment, I felt a mix of fear and curiosity rushing within me. The woman dropped the bag on the floor and after putting all the groceries inside the fridge, she took hold of my bottle and placed it on the kitchen table. 



I took a vast look around. I saw a grey, soft sofa, a big-screened television, a grand dining table, cool lights, baby toys and thick books. For extra information, I spotted a bowl of fruit on my left side and a jar of peanut butter and Nutella on the right. After, the lady raced outside in the rush.



Since the woman was not there, I tried to escape. However, from gnawing walls to kicking sides, none of them seemed to work. Exhausted, I drifted to slumber. I awoke to the sight of a creeping-looking child. He had his school bag on and a threatening hairstyle. His grin was so menacing that I thought he was going to penetrate something sharp into me or mash me up into a disgusting paste……

<b> TUESDAY - The Deadly Days 2024/03/26 </b>

It turns out that I misunderstood the boy’s intention and underestimated his power of damage. The human, whose name was Joe, shook my bottle intensely like a roller coaster, twisting and turning in every direction. I called it torture time. 


And what is worse, my tummy started to rumble ravenously because I hadn’t eaten a thing since the filthy lady captured me. Missing my favourite diet, flies, I realized there was no sign of food in this transparent prison. 


My problem escalated when I saw Joe wearing a fancy hat labelled Easter hat along with an empty basket. As soon as he left, I tried to find an escape route around his room. I saw bookshelves stuffed with novels that were twice the thickness of a plate, three tables covered with paper, and I spotted a big queen-sized bed. 


However, no part of the room has a place to escape. Hopelessly, I let go of my web and prepared to starve to death while I began losing my conscience. Suddenly, I heard a loud BANG! The door creaked open, and in the walked Joe with the basket now full of biscuits, eggs and chocolate. I felt a joy leaping across my heart when the human grasped a chocolate egg, opened my lid and…


…Only to throw the heavy object onto me which caused incredible pain. My back was a bit cracked and after I finished rubbing it to become less sore and painful, I reached out for the Easter egg. 


Unfortunately, before I got a nibble, Joe took it out with his dirty hand and demolished it with one gulp. It is even more disgusting than you can ever imagine. Starving, exhausted and more desperate than ever, I dozed off.
