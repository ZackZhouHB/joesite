    <p>Once upon a time, a young boy named Jack, whose dream was to become a reporter, the bravest and most inspiriting one in the world to speak out the truth. Jack had been learning and practising towards his goal since he was little.</p>

<p>Everything changed one day; while the child’s mother was cooking and his dad was coding, a gang was outside robbing and burning the townsfolks’ homes. Abandoning everything, Jack’s family joined others fleeing to a safer place. When he was running away, he spotted his favourite books and scripts were all on fire !</p>

<p>Jack’s family sent him to a local refugee school, although the new place felt like something other than home. There, he finally had a place to continue his education. Before long, the family settled back into everyday life.</p>

<p>A few years later, Jack’s hard work got him a interview as a journalist. On the way heading to the interview, Jack practised his script one last time. However, the teenager started to worry about losing this opportunity if he failed. Suddenly, he felt nervous and started to sweat uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Jack kept worrying and couldn’t concentrate. When it was Jack’s turn, he stumbled over his words when he just began to read his scripts.</p>

<p>“On December… number..uhh..nine…and….” Jack stammered.</p>

<p>The teenager felt embarrassed and depressed when he noticed the negative result, so he walked away sadly. Jack just wanted to escape and booked a ticket back to his hometown for a break. When he visited the family’s old cottage, he surprisingly found a charred practising paper from one of his old scripts underneath a burned brick. Gazing at the familiar handwriting when he was little, together with the burnt place, Jack realized his unfulfilled dream. At that moment, courage renewed through his mind: “I shall chase my dream no matter how !!”</p>

<p>Jack immediately flew back and restarted his preparation for the next speech.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, he was able to get another chance. This time, Jack took a deep breath to avoid being distracted by other thoughts and attended the interview confidently.</p>

<p>When he walked off the stage, biting his fingernails, Jack stayed positive about his result.</p>

<p>The following week, a congratulation email popped on his phone.</p>

<p>Jack’s eyes widened when he realized he had secured the job. He was thrilled to call his parent to thank them for their all-time support.</p>

<p>After years of hard work as a reporter, he eventually became one of the most famous journalists in the country. Jack fearlessly exposed hundreds of robbers and gangsters through his investigation; he even risked his life by going undercover to reveal the truth.</p>

<p>That was Jack’s story.</p>
